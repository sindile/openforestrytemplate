This is the version .1 of the open forestry template. 

The wish is to build a fairly comprehensive database with all the things a forester would find useful and make that available in QGIS and PostGIS. I'm also planning on building a spatialite version also. 

The entire thing is GPL 2.0 for now. 

Right now I have a script that builds a simple database in postgis. 

*All tables are simple geometry and in EPSG4326
*Right now Calculations are defaulting to EPSG:2274 (TN Stateplane Projection)
*Right now I'm using it to store client information on my local workstation - so it is being used. 
*USE AT YOUR OWN RISK 
*Documentation will be added slowly and deliberately.
